## About
This application was made in the third week of the [Codaisseur](https://www.codaisseur.com/) traineeship program. It is a simple to-do app  covering how to work with JavaScript in a Rails application.

## What I've learned from this project
1. How to make AJAX requests in a Rails application (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH)
2. Dinamically update the UI using jQuery

## Getting Started
1. Make sure [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#installing-rails) are installed in your system

2. Clone the repository and enter the project directory

3. Install all dependencies

  ```bash
  bundle install
  ```
4. Create database and migrate schema

  ```bash
  rake db:create
  rake db:migrate
  ```
  
5. Run the application - it should be available on http://localhost:3000

  ```bash
  rails s
  ```
